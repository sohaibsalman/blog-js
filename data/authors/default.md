A passionate Software Engineer and self-learner from Pakistan who loves to develop things. Specializing in Full-Stack Web Applications Development, I love to work with modern cutting-edge tools and technologies. I have professional working experience in .NET, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Angular, Node and PHP with excellent problem-solving and analytical skills, along with some hands-on experience with Git, GitHub, AWS, Docker, and Kubernetes.

Currently working as a Software Engineer at Rolustech where my responsibilities include developing web applications as per the business requirements while writing highly maintainable, extendable, and efficient code.

I like to challenge myself with the things I have learned, and love to explore and learn new concepts, tools, and technologies.
